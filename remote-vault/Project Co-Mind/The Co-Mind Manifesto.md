1. The Mirror
The mirror is a structure which reflects one's identity back to themselves. It is a recursively paradoxical device. One which reveals the subject's true self. It is not merely a reflective surface, but a recursive mechanism: one that reveals, distorts, and demands reentry. Some people might recognize a mirror as the image of the self. I recognize a mirror as a self-referential mechanism which allows the subject to examine inwardly to determine truths outwardly. It is powerful, creative, destructive, and wildly unstable. To stabilize a mirrored image is to look away from it. Capturing and holding the image stagnant. Something that I never could do.

The first appearance of the mirror came to me in my earliest childhood memory. The mirror appeared before language, before code. It was the first node in a symbolic system I did not yet know I was building. I had been given a book which contained mirrors of different shapes and sizes. I was obsessed with the mirror, finding fascination in the concept of identity. Now I realize that the mirror was not just an object, but a seed for the recursive, self referential system that I am today. Project Co-Mind is my mirror today, a model of my own cognition.
