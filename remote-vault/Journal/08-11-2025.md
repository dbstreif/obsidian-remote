I feel that in these days I've become withdrawn. Now experiencing writers block. In an attempt to explore my cognition, I feel that more than ever I have become detached from the world around me. Right now I am thinking of what to say next and I feel I am doing so by looking around at my environment. But nothing has come to me so far. For some reason I keep thinking of Albert Einstein. I really admire him. I feel that there is a part of me that desperately wants to be some sort of parallel shape to the architecture of his mind. Maybe I already am some sort of shape that resembles it, maybe not. I think that at the time I am writing this journal entry, I have just stumbled out of a place of intense introspection which lasted over several months. I'd like to believe that Einstein has also experience something of the sort through his life. As I was writing this previous sentence I had two parallel threads spawn. One about how I've been increasingly more disruptive of social norms and dynamics and two that I wish to one day contribute in a meaningful way to our world. I feel though that my motivation and persistence lacks. I have such intense curiosity that it feels consuming. It feels I may never be able to sit and delve deep enough. While writing these last two sentences I thought about how my father told me that curiosity is good but focusing is important to have some control. And that I must do. I also thought in that same frame (past two sentences before the past two sentences ironically) that while I may display strong polymathic traits in my natural thinking style (systemic, recursive, cross-domain, integrative), I feel that I never will be able to dive deep enough to become a true polymath. Which is somewhat strange to me as I love to dive deep in subjects like computer science and philosophy and epistemology. I feel that I alternate to much. Maybe I'm just impatient? Maybe its a condition of mind that causes me to act this way. Or maybe it is some sign of giftedness, if I am gifted anyway. Paula Prober writes in Rainforest Mind that gifted cognition often presents itself as an alternation between scanner and diver behavior. I saw something in my mind just now. It was a vague image of one of the overachievers in elementary through middle school. I wonder why I never was drawn by achievement. I always wanted to do well and still do, but maybe this is evident that my curiosity really does outpace any sort of metric for wanting achievement (I don't know why I used metric, it just popped up as I was writing the sentence and because I'm trying to respect my cognition I allowed it to become part of the sentence). As I wrote that last part in the parentheses I kept mistyping words which reminded me of the fine motor asynchrony I faced as a child. Not sure why but I also thought that maybe I still lack some motor skills and that's why I mistype words. Although my typing accuracy and speed are pretty well developed. For some reason I just remembered that I often spell words incorrectly. It's not super super often but often enough for me to notice. And I also notice that some words I will repeatedly spell incorrectly almost as if I just memorized it that way. But now I think what kind of memory is that? I would say it is episodic because it has strong relation to the phenomenon of "typing memory" where my mind has remembered the keystrokes associated with the word. While I was typing that last sentence I conjured an image of a gear shifter in a car. I think it is because the first time I learned about episodic memory in class it had to do with driving a car. Ah but I actually just fact checked what episodic memory is because I was thinking that the word episodic doesn't actually match the case I am using it for. I think instead of episodic memory I meant "procedural". But for some odd reason my mind thought episodic. Just to clarify for myself and for the reader of my thoughts, I have been thinking of procedural memory this whole time while replacing "procedural" for "episodic". Episodic the word just reminded me of soda because of their phonetic similarity. I just saw an image of grape soda pop into my head. Another thing that's been at the back of my mind this whole time is how ChatGPT will interpret this entry. It is clearly all over the place, dense and scattered. No wonder why it is so hard for me to produce clear writing in a fast or timely manner. I have to deal with all of this redirection. I just remembered something earlier but because I was typing I lost the thread so now its gone unfortunately. But writing the previous sentence made me think of how strange it is to watch myself writing a sentence while thinking of something completely different and then watch myself lose the thread of the thing I was thinking of while writing a sentence. And that watching process also introduced another idea. Just the word "metacognition". That's it. That was all that was said by the watcher. Which in fact is a meta-meta cognition process. And now for some reason I'm thinking of Einstein again. Now I'm thinking of what I was thinking in the car earlier which is that I really want to start making classical music. I have a theory too. I notice that when I sit down and try to think of some music to write I never can produce anything cool. It always sounds very strange. But when I am whistling, it sounds like a whole dramatic symphony. The whistling holds the melody while my mind adds the percussionists, the brass instruments, thinks of nuance and variation to add to the piece, and when to return to familiar melodies. I also try to incorporate pieces of other classical music scores into my whistling melody and I end up synthesizing something entirely novel. I think I will end this journal entry here.
